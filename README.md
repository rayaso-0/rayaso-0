- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rayaso-0 | AKA Kristoef B. | Currently a student at University of North Carolina at Charlotte 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything that is related to computers. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Javascript, and Java. I plan on learning everything regarding Full Stack. 

- ðŸ“« You can reach me through on my personal email: "rayaso.787@gmail.com" | Please be sure to specify that you found me through GitHub! 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm self taught piano for six years now! (and counting...) | I play a LOT of chess.

(I will add more here once I get my feet wet in the GitHub space and the programming community in general!)
